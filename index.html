				<p>Help! I need somebody! When we started thinking about teachers for this event, we reflected on our experiences at all of the camps, and weekenders that we have attended over the last five years. The teachers that are at this weekender have made an impact on us in way that ensures fun, inclusiveness, and talent. For those teachers who were not available this year we will hopefully have you next year!</p>
				<p>We've got the following teachers who can help you if they can:</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<h3>Cat &amp; Cam</h3>
						<p class="teacher-intro">
							Cat is our Lindy Madonna. The (very young) Grandmother of Lindy in Liverpool and we love her. All you need is love when you pair Cat, and her fabulous teaching partner, Cam!  Every class with this talented and hilarious twosome will leave you living for Lindy!
						</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<h3>María &amp; Aurélien</h3>
						<p class="teacher-intro">
							Here comes the sun with this teaching couple, hailing from their adopted home of Barcelona! These two have rhythm!! Maria and Aurelien were the first international teaching couple that we hosted here at Mersey Swing (other than Cat and Cam of course) and we have been itching to dance again with them ever since!

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6 coming-soon">
						<h3>Do you want to know a secret?</h3>
						<p>
							You'll have to wait a little while for us to confirm our full teaching line up. Don't worry, it won't be long, long, long until our next announcement!

				<h3>Registration opens at 11am on Saturday 1st December</h3>
				<p>For this event we are using google forms. This means that the cost of the event is lower by not charging administration fees, however, it will mean a little bit of time between registration and confirmation of place. Please be patient with us as we are going slightly old school with our registration process.</p>
				<p>Get by with a little help from your friends, here's a handy guide to registration:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To register for Lindy in the Sky you will need to fill in a google registration form. You will receive an automated response, indicating that we have received your registration.</li>
					<li>Completion of the registration form does not guarantee your place. Providing there is space in your track, you will be sent a confirmation email with payment details.</li>
					<li>If you are booking as a couple, only one of you needs to register but please provide details of both individuals. One payment should be received for both individuals.</li>
					<li>Once you receive the payment details, please make sure payment is received within 1 week of confirmation. Your place is not confirmed until payment is received.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Group Bookings</h3>
				<p>Come together? Right now? Have a look over here:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For group bookings, only the Group Leader need apply. The Group Leader will need to complete the google form with the names, levels and email addresses of the dancers.</li>
					<li>The Group Leader will be sent the bank details for payment and would be responsible for one single payment for the entire group.</li>
					<li>Each group must have equal follows and leaders. This is the responsibility of the Group Leader to maintain.</li>
					<li>Group bookings are eligible for groups of 8 or more.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="contact">Any questions? email <a href="mailto:info@lindyinthesky.co.uk">info@lindyinthesky.co.uk</a> and we'll get back to you with the word.</p>

				<h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<h3>Early Bird Discounts</h3>
				<p>The first 35 couples tickets will receive the discounted price against the full weekend couples ticket. So, you better think right, you better do right by yourself and get your ticket to ride early! The early bird discount won't be automatically applied.</p>
				<h3>Wait List</h3>
				<p>If one or the other dance role sells out quickly then there will be a wait list. Once more of the opposite dance role tickets are sold, waitlist places will be released to those who have registered interest. You will be emailed if a place becomes available.</p>
				<h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
				<p>Unfortunately, we do not provide refunds for cancellations for any reason. However, we will accept transfer of the tickets to a different dancer. The ticket will need to be transferred to someone who is dancing the same role and track. It is easier for us if you transfer your ticket directly to the person who is buying your ticket from you.</p>
				<p>Please provide us with any name changes.</p>
				<h3>Alcohol Policy</h3>
				<p>Ages: 18s and over are welcome.</p>
				<p>Friday and Saturday night at the Stanley Theatre a cash bar will be available. A water station will also be available. Reasonably priced drinks!</p>
				<p>The Tea Dance on Sunday will serve tea and cake.</p>
				<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
				<p>We endeavour to provide a safer place to dance. We reserve the right to reject and eject obnoxious, rude, or offensive behaviour. Thankfully we have never had to do this as dancing is fun!</p>
